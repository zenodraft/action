# `zenodraft/action@0.14.0` PRERELEASE

Automates drafting depositions on Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox.

## Features

1. Choose which platform you want to draft your deposition on (Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox), and easily switch between them.
2. Choose to create your draft deposition as a new version in an existing concept, or as a new deposition in a new concept.
3. Choose to finalize the deposition as part of the automation, or leave the deposition as draft for you to inspect and publish manually by clicking the button on Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox.
4. Publish a snapshot of the repository as a zip or tar.gz.
5. Instead of publishing a snapshot, select a subset of files to publish.
6. Automatically attach metadata such as title, authors, and contributors to your deposition using information from a file in your repository.
7. Choose to upsert the prereserved DOI in the draft deposition's citation metadata file `CITATION.cff`.

## Example workflow

Creates a draft snapshot of your repository contents as a new version in concept `1234567` on Zenodo Sandbox using metadata from repository file `.zenodo.json`.

```yaml
name: zenodraft
on:
  # Trigger when you publish a release via GitHub's release page
  release:
    types:
      - published

jobs:
  publish:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout the contents of your repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: Create a draft snapshot of your repository contents as a new
                version in concept 1234567 on Zenodo Sandbox using metadata
                from repository file .zenodo.json
          env:
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            ZENODO_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ZENODO_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          uses: zenodraft/action@0.14.0
          with:
            concept: 1234567
            metadata: .zenodo.json
            publish: false
            sandbox: true
```

## Supported workflow triggers

The following workflow trigger events are supported:

1. Publishing a GitHub release

    ```yaml
    on:
      release:
        types:
        - published
    ```

    With this trigger event, any non-draft releases and prereleases that you make via GitHub's releases page will in turn trigger
    the workflow to create a new deposition on Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox once you press the `Publish` button.

    Editing an existing release, such as when you add an artifact to a preexisting release, or change the release notes of a
    preexisting release, do not trigger the workflow.

    If you are using `upsert-doi` to make changes to your repository files before uploading any files to Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox,
    those changes will be part of the deposition, and the workflow will also commit those changes to your repository.

1. Manually triggering via the `Actions` tab
 
    ```yaml
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
    ```

    With this trigger event, you can manually start the workflow via the `Actions` tab of your repository on GitHub. Besides creating
    the deposition on Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox, the workflow will create a new release on your repository's releases page.

    The workflow will attempt to assign the release tag value from the `version` key in the file that input argument `metadata` points
    to, or if that hasn't been defined, from the `version` key in file `CITATION.cff` if that file exists and the key has been defined.
    If neither exists, the workflow will use the short notation of the latest commit as tag value for the release.

    If you are using `upsert-doi` to make changes to your repository files before uploading any files to Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox,
    those changes will be part of the deposition, and the workflow will also commit those changes to your repository.

Any other events than `release published` or `workflow_dispatch` will raise an error.

## Input parameters

### `compression`

- default value: `zip`
- choices: `zip` | `tar.gz`
- overruled by `filenames`

Which compression to use when making a snapshot of the entire repository.

### `concept`

By leaving `concept` unspecified, the draft is created as a new deposition in a new concept. Alternatively, you can
have the new draft appear as a new version in a concept that you own on the target platform by assigning the concept
identifier such as `1234567` to `concept`. You can find the concept identifier via Zenodo's frontend as the last
part of the DOI listed under _Cite all versions?_ in the sidebar.

### `filenames`

- overrules argument `compression`

List of space-separated filenames that should be uploaded separately instead of the default behavior of
uploading a snapshot of the entire repository as an archive.

### `metadata`

Used to specify which file holds the metadata to be associated with the deposition. The metadata file
should be a valid JSON file in Zenodo metadata format.

### `publish`

- default value: `false`

Whether to automate finalizing the draft deposition as part of the automation (`publish: true`), or
to leave it to the user to click `Publish` manually after inspecting the draft deposition on the
respective platform (`publish: false`).

### `upsert-doi`

- default value: `false`
- requires: `upsert-location`

If `true`, update the citation metadata file `CITATION.cff` with the draft deposition's prereserved DOI
before uploading any files to Zenodo or Zenodo Sandbox.

### `upsert-location`

- choices: `doi` | `identifiers` | `identifiers[i]`
- only relevant when `upsert-doi` is `true`

Where to insert the prereserved DOI value in `CITATION.cff`. Valid options are `doi`, `identifiers`, or
`identifiers[i]`, where `i` should be replaced with an integer index into the array `identifiers`. The indexing is zero-based.

### `sandbox`

- default value: `true`

Whether to create the draft deposition on Zenodo  (`sandbox: false`; production) or Zenodo Sandbox
(`sandbox: true`; testing and development).

### `verbose`

- default value: `false`

Whether the logging should be verbose.


## Access tokens and repository secrets

To use `zenodraft/action`, a personal access token is required, one for each platform you plan on using
(Zenodo Sandbox, Zenodo). `zenodraft/action` looks for the access token in the environment variables
named `ZENODO_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ZENODO_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The example workflow above shows that these
variables are assigned their value from the repository's secrets. Visit Zenodo Sandbox
(https://sandbox.zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/) and/or
Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/) to create your own tokens, then go to
[https://github.com/&lt;organization name&gt;/&lt;repository name&gt;/settings/secrets/actions](https://github.com/%3Corganization%20name%3E/%3Crepository%20name%3E/settings/secrets/actions)
to set your repository secret.

You don't have to create a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret&mdash;GitHub has already done that for you&mdash;but you do need
to get its value from the `secrets` and assign it to an environment variable, as in the example workflow at the
top of this README.
